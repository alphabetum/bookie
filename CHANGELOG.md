## 0.0.1 (2011.04.23)

Add some barely functional Parser and Document object stubs, initial gem release
to claim the namespace.

## 0.0.2 (2011.04.23)

Create some stubs for Paragraph and ContentTree objects, enough for us to start
thinking about what the emitter API might look like. But not really enough to do
anything else.
