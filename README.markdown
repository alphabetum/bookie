# Bookie: An ebook publishing toolchain in pure Ruby

While I have not looked especially far and wide, I haven't found a book
publishing toolchain that I like which both has a nice workflow AND does not
rely on a ton of heavyweight dependencies. Since I have a real need for
outputting nice documents in PDF, ePUB, and MOBI format, I am going to
experiment with building a tool to do this in a way I find nice.

## Roadmap

My initial goal is just to mess around with parsing a tiny subset of Markdown
into Ruby objects. Once I've got that far, I'll work on a proof of concept PDF
outputter, probably using Prawn. If I make it that far without discovering some
obviously better tool or deciding that this is going to be a huge time sink,
I'll re-visit this document and put together a proper release plan.

## Contributing

I'm happy to accept contributions to this project, but probably won't
have a formal process for doing so until I've gone beyond the proof of concept
phase. Please do catch up with me if you have questions, suggestions, or ideas
though. I am @seacreature on Freenode and twitter, and my email address is
