# Things to do and/or think about
  
* Emitter experiment is useful for getting some ideas about how all this will
  hang together, but is as of right now untested and hard codes several
  assumptions that should probably be configurable.

* QUESTION: To what extent should the parser mess with whitespace characters?
  Currently aggressively mangling whitespace as needed.

* Need to come up with some sort of DSL-ish manifest so that Bookie can handle
  more than one chapter at once and so MOBI format can have a proper book name
  in the Kindle home page.
