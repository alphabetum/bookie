# Things to do and/or think about

## Whitespace

* To what extent should the parser mess with whitespace characters? Should
  paragraphs retain or strip newlines? (Currently stripping)

## Testing

* Emitter experiment is useful for getting some ideas about how all this will
  hang together, but is as of right now untested and also introduces new
  features to Parser and Document that are untested. Should resolve before 
  more forward development happens.
