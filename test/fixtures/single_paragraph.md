However, it isnâ€™t sufficient just to have a group of people studying the craft
of software development: those have existed as long as software has existed and
if they were capable of closing this gap, they would have done so by now. A lack

communities, and the end result is a polarizing effect that causes direct harm
to real progress by generating far more heat than light whenever a certain tool
or technique is discussed.
